<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
On the nineteenth day of August, in the year of nineteen two,</div><div class="verse">
Most kind and gracious Madame Stork right over Norfolk flew,</div><div class="verse">
And brought to my dear mother there a wonderful surprise,</div><div class="verse">
A little red brown baby girl with large blackberry eyes.</div><div class="verse">
Now, mother she had asked the stork to bring to her much joy,</div><div class="verse">
And drop a bundle at her door containing a wee boy,</div><div class="verse">
But when the stork made a mistake and brought just little me,</div><div class="verse">
She thought that I was better far than any boy could be.</div><div class="verse">
And wrapped me in the blanket which she'd planned for my wee brother,</div><div class="verse">
And which my dear "MA MIE" had knit to help my busy mother.</div><div class="verse">
She changed the name of Lionel to little Winifred,</div><div class="verse">
And all the things for brother planned, she gave to me instead.</div>

</div>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Long, long ago, before this earth had any girls and boys</div><div class="verse">
To hang their stockings on the shelf, expecting Christmas toys,</div><div class="verse">
Good Santa was a big white cloud that floated in the sky;</div><div class="verse">
if you had lived in those old days, you'd seen him floating by.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
But when the children came to rule upon good Mother Earth,</div><div class="verse">
She took kind Santa from the sky and made him God of Mirth;</div><div class="verse">
To bring at every Christmas time good gifts to girls and boys</div><div class="verse">
And make them all so happy with a lot of lovely toys.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Far, far among the icebergs, in the cold and freezing zone,</div><div class="verse">
She built for him a palace, where he lives almost alone,</div><div class="verse">
With only good old Mrs. Claus to keep him company,</div><div class="verse">
And sometimes Cousin Nicholas for two days or for three.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Wise Mother Earth she knew this clime would suit good Santa well,</div><div class="verse">
For here no foolish, idle folks would ever come to dwell;</div><div class="verse">
Nor pay the good Saint visits which would waste his precious time,</div><div class="verse">
While he could work much faster here than in a warmer clime.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
But never did he suffer from the icebergs at the Pole,</div><div class="verse">
As Fairies kept his fireplace all full of red hot coal;</div><div class="verse">
Or heaped bright burning logs on it as full as it could hold,</div><div class="verse">
So Santa never felt at all old Jack Frost's biting cold.
</div></div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Likewise these Fairies brought to him and his most faithful spouse,</div><div class="verse">
Just everything that they could need to keep a cozy house,</div><div class="verse">
And even cooked their victuals and brought them every day</div><div class="verse">
Exactly at the proper time, upon a huge hot tray.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
And after they had eaten all the dainties on the tiny,</div><div class="verse">
The good kind fairies they would come and take the tray away;</div><div class="verse">
So Mrs. Claus had no excuse for being cross or sad,</div><div class="verse">
Since no experience she had had with Bridgets getting mad.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
When Santa finished all his toys, he put them in a sack,</div><div class="verse">
Where he intended carrying them upon his great broad back,</div><div class="verse">
But Mother Earth surprised the saint and to his palace led</div><div class="verse">
Eight lovely prancing reindeer and a large commodious sled.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
These reindeer were the cousins of swift Pegasus, the steed</div><div class="verse">
Who helped the hero Perseus when he was in great need;</div><div class="verse">
And like the flying hero horse, they lived up in the sky,</div><div class="verse">
'Till Mother Earth had need of them to help old Santa fly.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
And so on every Christmas eve for full ten hundred years,</div><div class="verse">
Good Santa and his reindeer fleet have banished childrens' tears,</div><div class="verse">
By bringing them 'most all the gifts their little hearts could wish,</div><div class="verse">
And filling stockings, shoes and plates and great round pudding dish.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
But when last Christmas came around, good Mother Earth she said,</div><div class="verse">
"Dear Santa I have something fine for you to use instead</div><div class="verse">
Of your good, faithful reindeer and your big old fashioned sled,</div><div class="verse">
For here's a lovely aeroplane all painted shining red."
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
The wise old lady then declared that he could safely fly</div><div class="verse">
With this machine 'most anywhere away up in the sky,</div><div class="verse">
And travel far, far faster than reindeer who were fleet</div><div class="verse">
But stumbled sometimes on the roofs made slippery with sleet.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
The aeroplane could carry well a larger load of toys,</div><div class="verse">
So he could visit more good girls and also little boys,</div><div class="verse">
Who live in far off heathen lands where everyone's a sinner,</div><div class="verse">
But that's no reason each should do without a Christmas dinner.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
With this machine he'd save some time to look out for each pet</div><div class="verse">
Of all the little girls and boys as they so oft forget</div><div class="verse">
To treat their pets most kindly upon the Christmas morn</div><div class="verse">
In memory of the Saviour, who on this day was born.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
And likewise all the horses, the cows and pigs and sheep,</div><div class="verse">
For men so seldom think of them when Christmas time they keep;</div><div class="verse">
And even wild, fierce animals, and fishes in the sea,</div><div class="verse">
Should all be made quite happy at Christmas time to be.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
"I do not like this plan at all of giving up my sled</div><div class="verse">
And my good faithful reindeer," so good old Santa said.</div><div class="verse">
But Mother Earth she laughed at him and said she would repay</div><div class="verse">
The reindeer, whom she would send home, straight to the milky way.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
But Santa was old fashioned and had great fears to fly</div><div class="verse">
Without his sled and reindeer, he'd used in years gone by,</div><div class="verse">
And begged that on his maiden trip these true old friends to take</div><div class="verse">
To help him should the aeroplane prove but a wicked fake.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
The laughing Earth she granted him this very small request,</div><div class="verse">
And early on glad Christmas eve (the eve of all most blest),</div><div class="verse">
He started forth upon his trip, did good old Santa, dear,</div><div class="verse">
Guiding his Wright aeroplane with feelings of great fear.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
But Mother Earth showed she was wise and knew just what was best</div><div class="verse">
To help the good old tired saint while on his children quest;</div><div class="verse">
And fast the good Wright aeroplane it flew both low and high,</div><div class="verse">
So Santa took the Earth's advice, and though he heaved a sigh,
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
He dropped the poor old worn out sled as he was passing by,</div><div class="verse">
And people said, who saw it fall, "A METEOR FROM THE SKY!"</div><div class="verse">
Then kissing each good reindeer, he bade them all farewell,</div><div class="verse">
And left them in the MILKY WAY, forever there to dwell.
</div></div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
And you, my little children, who have heard the tiny hoofs</div><div class="verse">
Of the little flying steeds pattering on the roofs,</div><div class="verse">
If you would like to catch a glimpse of Santa's good reindeer,</div><div class="verse">
Then wait until it's dark some night, and when the sky is clear,</div><div class="verse">
You'll see them very plainly in the broad light MILKY WAY,</div><div class="verse">
And there for all the time to come, these steeds will romp and play.
</div></div>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
How glad I am that I was born in this land very dear,</div><div class="verse">
Where children have a Santa Claus of whom they have no fear;</div><div class="verse">
A Santa who is always kind, remembering one and all,</div><div class="verse">
When every year at Christmas time, he pays us all a call.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
In far away chill Norway, there NISSEN is the name</div><div class="verse">
Of the Christmas visitor who bears good Santa's fame;</div><div class="verse">
But he's a naughty brownie, so short and very small;</div><div class="verse">
Not a bit like Santa, who is large and fat and tall.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
But like our good gift giver, his beard is long and white,</div>
<div class="verse">
And he wears a coat of furs and many colors bright;</div>
<div class="verse">
But instead of bringing goodies to good girls and to boys,</div>
<div class="verse">
Nice new clothes and books and games and lots of wondrous toys.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
He expects that all the big folks and also little ones,</div>
<div class="verse">
Should leave his favorite dishes, such as puddings, cakes and buns,</div>
<div class="verse">
Outside of every doorway, so that he may eat at will</div>
<div class="verse">
Of these luscious dainties until he has had his fill.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
Then after eating all the cakes his "Tummy-tum" can hold,</div><div class="verse">
He milks the cows and splits the wood (at least so I've been told),</div><div class="verse">
But never thinks to bring nice gifts to little girls and boys,</div><div class="verse">
Whose parents have to trim their trees and buy them all their toys.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
Besides, this naughty NISSEN is cross at times and bad,</div><div class="verse">
And does all sorts of horrid tricks, which I think very sad</div><div class="verse">
At Christmas, when we all should be so kind to one another</div><div class="verse">
And treat each person whom we meet as if he were our brother.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
But NISSEN steals away the cows and even horses fleet,</div><div class="verse">
From all the people who forget to bake him puddings sweet;</div><div class="verse">
And if above a whisper one should dare to speak or sing</div><div class="verse">
About this cranky fellow, then this evil he will bring</div><div class="verse">
Upon the one who dared to throw, his name upon the breeze,</div><div class="verse">
As from that time the guilty one must sneeze and sneeze and sneeze.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Now in our land we sing loud praise of Santa all the time,</div><div class="verse">
And tell about his goodness great, in prose and jingling rhyme;</div><div class="verse">
And yet it seems the more we sing about the jolly elf,</div><div class="verse">
The more he brings each year to us upon the mantel shelf.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
But children in far Norway are better girls and boys</div><div class="verse">
Than we who live in this fair land and think so much of toys,</div><div class="verse">
That we forget about the pets while feeding our own selves,</div><div class="verse">
Like thoughtless, greedy little pigs or naughty selfish elves.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
While Norway children in the fall they work to gather corn,</div><div class="verse">
And save it for the birds they feed on every Christmas morn,</div><div class="verse">
So we should follow in their steps and feed the wee birds crumbs,</div><div class="verse">
Before we start to feast ourselves on Christmas sugar plums.</div>

When little Mary Alice was only three years old,</div><div class="verse">
She went upon a visit to Aunt Maria Hold,</div><div class="verse">
A lady who was noted for saving everything,</div><div class="verse">
From gold and silver dollars down to a turkey wing.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
She soon taught Mary Alice to never throw away</div><div class="verse">
A single bit of anything which might be used "some day,"</div><div class="verse">
And Alice, who was clever, she learned to put away</div><div class="verse">
All bits of ribbon, cloth and lace, and chicken feathers gay.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Each day she kept quite busy hunting something more</div><div class="verse">
Which she could take to Auntie or add to her own store;</div><div class="verse">
And one day in excitement, she ran in greatest haste,</div><div class="verse">
Crying, "Oh, dear Auntie, sumfins don to waste!</div><div class="verse">
A perfectlee dood kitty is thrown out on the dump</div><div class="verse">
Of the kitchen ash-pile, behind the garden pump!"</div>
</div></div></div>

Until he'd solved the problem about the CURIOUS ONE</div><div class="verse">
Who'd traveled far from Storkland, though she couldn't walk nor run.</div><div class="verse">
Then to his mother he declared in accents of dismay,</div><div class="verse">
"Dear mother we must send this kid back to her home to-day,</div><div class="verse">
'Cause someone's cheated us I know and brought us an old child</div><div class="verse">
With bald head and without a tooth and like an Indian wild."</div><div class="verse">
Whenever it begins to cry it almost lifts the roof,</div><div class="verse">
So mother, dear, I think 'tis best for you to keep aloof</div><div class="verse">
From the old ugly Indian thing and send it to Stork-land,</div><div class="verse">
Then you and I'll be glad again and go to hear the band.</div>

If you don't believe that whooping cough causes lots of woe,</div><div class="verse">
Just catch a few of whooping germs and then I guess you'll know</div><div class="verse">
That whoopee-whoop! and wheepee-wheeps! are not one bit of fun,</div><div class="verse">
When you see others playing games where all must jump and run,</div><div class="verse">
For if you jump or if you run, you start the whoop-oop-oop!</div><div class="verse">
And even when you're tired you can't sleep for the croup,</div><div class="verse">
Caused by the awful whooping bugs, which lurk within your throat</div><div class="verse">
And make your voice sound hoarser than the singing of a goat.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
For fear of spreading whooping-bugs you certainly can't go</div><div class="verse">
To Sunday-school or other school, or even to a show,</div><div class="verse">
But you must stay at home ALONE from three to six long weeks,</div><div class="verse">
And listen to your croaking voice, which whoops and sometimes squeaks.</div><div class="verse">
So therefore take the good advice of a little girl who knows,</div><div class="verse">
And stay away from WHOOPING-COUGH, which causes lots of woes.</div>

Fat dolls and plump dolls and dolls in the style,</div><div class="verse">
Hipless and jointless and dressed in a smile;</div><div class="verse">

Dutchies and Germans and cutest Dagoes;</div><div class="verse">
Dollies from Egypt and dollies from Spain,</div><div class="verse">

The string of these dollies seemed never to cease.</div><div class="verse">

Could never decide with which doll to play,</div><div class="verse">
So she was not happy as poor little Sue,</div><div class="verse">
Who in her doll family had only two</div><div class="verse">
Wretched rag dollies without any hair,</div><div class="verse">
But which she considered a most lovely pair,</div><div class="verse">
And these ugly dollies they gave her delight,</div><div class="verse">

<div class="verse">
Great Jack-the-Giant-Killer brave, he killed all giants bad,</div><div class="verse">

ARITHMOS was this giant great, and all bright girls and boys</div><div class="verse">
Should love the famous Giant-King far more than all their toys.</div><div class="verse">
He's very old, and very great, and also wondrous wise,</div><div class="verse">
For he can count all things on earth and even tell their size.</div><div class="verse">
He knows how many birds there are; how high each bird can fly,</div><div class="verse">
But never does he boast, or brag, or stoop to tell a lie.</div><div class="verse">
He is so tall that he can reach up to the starry sky</div><div class="verse">
And count the stars and meteors bright as swiftly they go by.</div><div class="verse">
'Tis he alone can tell you when a great eclipse will come</div><div class="verse">
And darken the moon's lady or the old man in the sun.</div><div class="verse">
He's always so good natured and obliging to us all;</div><div class="verse">
He'll help us with our lessons hard when for his aid we call,</div><div class="verse">
And tell us just the number of ripe apples on a plate,</div><div class="verse">
How far away Chicago is, and if the train is late.</div><div class="verse">
In fact he always answers us whene'er we ask "HOW MANY?"</div><div class="verse">
And for his work and trouble never thinks to ask a penny.</div><div class="verse">
All teachers and professors couldn't teach without his aid,</div><div class="verse">
And men in every business know through him they will be paid.</div><div class="verse">
We cannot sing in perfect time, nor even play a drum,</div><div class="verse">
Divide an apple, buy a doll nor do the smallest sum,</div><div class="verse">
And even BRIDGE by ladies fair cannot at all be played</div><div class="verse">
Unless this mighty GIANT-KING will kindly lend his aid.</div><div class="verse">
So as we cannot get along without "ARITHMOS LORE,"</div><div class="verse">

</div>

<p class="cb">(Written for Mrs. Anna Chase Brainard, of Buffalo, N. Y.)</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Once there was a little pup who lived in far off Kent,</div><div class="verse">
Where he was born some years ago in kennels of Lord Dent;</div><div class="verse">
His mother was of purest blood and likewise was his Pa,</div><div class="verse">
So he arrived upon this earth without a single flaw.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
His tail was just the proper size and so was each small ear,</div><div class="verse">
His shapely legs and nose and paws, they pleased his mother dear;</div><div class="verse">
And with her soft and scarlet tongue she kissed her baby pup</div><div class="verse">
And loved him, oh, so dearly, that she almost ate him up.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
The keeper of the kennels when he saw this terrier pup,</div><div class="verse">
Declared, "It's just a beauty and will surely win "THE CUP"</div><div class="verse">
For being a fox terrier of very purest breed</div><div class="verse">
And now to my dear master I'll go with greatest speed</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
And tell him of this puppy who will bring our kennels fame</div><div class="verse">
And ask him what he thinks will be a truly proper name</div><div class="verse">
For the most perfect terrier that ever came to Kent;</div><div class="verse">
It seems to me he should be called for my great master "Dent."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
The master when he heard the news that a new pup had come,</div><div class="verse">
Left off his game of playing cards and drinking pints of rum,</div><div class="verse">
And hastened to the kennels to behold the wondrous pup,</div><div class="verse">
Who at the coming dog show was to win the great prize cup.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
The mother dog she wagged her tail, with pride she was puffed up,</div><div class="verse">
As her great master stood right near and smiled upon her pup,</div><div class="verse">
While saying, "Higgens, listen well to what I have to say,</div><div class="verse">
And care for this good mother dog and her fine pup each day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
I'll name him for my ancestor, the great and famous Kent,</div><div class="verse">
And in that name to the dog show next year he shall be sent,</div><div class="verse">
Where I am sure he'll win the prize above all others there</div><div class="verse">
For he is perfect in his shape and has fine silky hair."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
So little Kent was tended well and petted every day,</div><div class="verse">
He never had to seek for bones and only had to play,</div><div class="verse">
And having nothing else to do on mischief he was bent,</div><div class="verse">
Was this aristocratic pup, owned by the great Lord Dent.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
And when a year had passed around, one day the master came</div><div class="verse">
To take him to the London show, where he would win great fame;</div><div class="verse">
But Kent was very naughty, as he did not wish to go</div><div class="verse">
Away from his good kennel home to any prize dog show.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
At last his master whipped Pup Kent and oh, but he did swear</div><div class="verse">
Because Kent snapped at Higgens, who was combing his fine hair</div><div class="verse">
And putting on a collar with a chain of golden beads;</div><div class="verse">
Such ornaments Kent could not see that any puppy needs.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
At last the royal pup was dressed in pupdom regal style,</div><div class="verse">
And drove in a fine carriage, oh, for many a weary mile,</div><div class="verse">
Until he came to London town, where nothing he could see,</div><div class="verse">
Because all things were bidden with a fog as thick as could be.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>

<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Before he'd even time to think, this 'ristocratic pup,</div><div class="verse">
He found himself in a small cage with all the doors shut up,</div><div class="verse">
And many men were standing round and gazing long at him,</div><div class="verse">
While passing comments on his shape of head, and tail, and limb.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Kent glared at them in silence and he would not wag his tail,</div><div class="verse">
In fact just like a good young boy who might be put in jail</div><div class="verse">
When he had never done a thing to break the country's law,</div><div class="verse">
So felt this little terrier, this pup without a flaw.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
And when the judges thought that he should have the ribbon blue</div><div class="verse">
Because of his most perfect blood shown by the records true,</div><div class="verse">
He snapped and barked and even bit at those who came quite near</div><div class="verse">
To tie the lovely ribbon on the neck of "PUPPY DEAR."</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
So they decided that despite his wondrous pedigree</div><div class="verse">
There yet was something in his blood that ought not there to be</div><div class="verse">
And gave the prize, a silver cup, to a more common dog,</div><div class="verse">
Who lay so still and quiet that he might have been a log.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
But when that evening our Lord Dent beheld with great surprise</div><div class="verse">
That a less blooded terrier had won the noble prize,</div><div class="verse">
He felt so very angry that he wished to beat Pup Kent,</div><div class="verse">
And ordered that the beastly dog should quickly home be sent.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
But while poor Kent was going home so sad and in disgrace,</div><div class="verse">
He got away from Higgens and he found another place</div><div class="verse">
Far, far away from kennels of the great and wealthy Dent,</div><div class="verse">
Near to a peaceful village, the runaway he went.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Here he lay down so tired and thought of many a bone,</div><div class="verse">
Which now was being gnawed each day by his good ma alone,</div><div class="verse">
Since Dent, her darling puppy boy, was oh, so far away,</div><div class="verse">
Oh, how he wished to gnaw a bone with his good ma this day!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
But as he lay a dreaming of lovely things to eat,</div><div class="verse">
Quite suddenly a large gray rat ran right across his feet,</div><div class="verse">
And after it there followed an Irishman named Pat,</div><div class="verse">
Who sought to make a timely end of bad old Mister Rat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Big Pat was armed with a huge club and called to his old dog,</div><div class="verse">
"Now, come along ye lazy baste, before he's in the bog!"</div><div class="verse">
Then Kent he jumped and in one bound he seized poor Mister Rat,</div><div class="verse">
Shook him about 'till he was dead and then brought him to Pat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Big Pat he gazed in wonder at the clever little dog,</div><div class="verse">
And sitting down upon a large and green moss covered log,</div><div class="verse">
Said, "Shure, ye bate this lazy hound that kennot catch a rat,</div><div class="verse">
And if ye'll stay right here, me boy, I'll trate ye well," says Pat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
Then proudly Kent he wagged his tail and tried so hard to smile</div><div class="verse">
Upon the good old Irishman, who patted him awhile,</div><div class="verse">
Then coaxed the stranger after him right through a broad green lane,</div><div class="verse">
Which led to the fine country home of good Sir Michael Kane.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
And here Pat introduced the pup to all the family,</div><div class="verse">
And they were all so very kind as any folks could be,</div><div class="verse">
They patted his soft silky hair and praised him to the sky,</div><div class="verse">
And gave him a big gravy dish all filled with nice meat pie,</div><div class="verse">
And likewise a huge saucer, which was full of real sweet cream,</div><div class="verse">
Which made the hungry doggie think that he was in a dream.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
So here Dog Kent decided was the best place for to dwell,</div><div class="verse">
And here he still is living and is feeling very well.</div><div class="verse">
He goes each morning to the barn and helps his good friend Pat</div><div class="verse">
To catch the naughty rodents, who are called the name of RAT.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
The cook she feeds him daily, and he captures all the mice,</div><div class="verse">
Which love to haunt the kitchen of the cleanly Bridget Bryce.</div><div class="verse">
While little Mikey loves dear Kent far more than all his toys,</div><div class="verse">
And says he'd rather play with him than any girls or boys,</div><div class="verse">
Because he never minds a bit to jump right in the pond</div><div class="verse">
And bring to land a stick or stone or weeping willow wand.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
He always acts politely to all who may come near,</div><div class="verse">
And so all strangers pet him and think he is a dear.</div><div class="verse">
They like his soft and silky hair, which proves he has good blood,</div><div class="verse">
And never does he make folks mad by tracking floors with mud.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
He's wiser than most common dogs, whose hair is rough and coarse,</div><div class="verse">
His bark is always pleasant, and 'tis never loud nor hoarse;</div><div class="verse">
He's swifter also than slow dogs who cannot catch a rat,</div><div class="verse">
Because they always eat too much and get so very fat.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i-2">MORAL.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse">
This story proves that good, pure blood is a fine thing to own,</div><div class="verse">
But it can't help the puppies or the children all alone,</div><div class="verse">
Unless these youthful puppies and the children, very small,</div><div class="verse">
Learn to keep quite busy and to have a smile for all.</div>

When the teacher asked young Leo to write a little rhyme</div><div class="verse">

About the common animal, which children call a goat:</div><div class="verse">
A goat is stronger than a pig,</div><div class="verse">
But often it is not as big.</div><div class="verse">
It has four legs just like a horse,</div><div class="verse">
But never runs on a race-course.</div><div class="verse">
It gives good milk, though not as much</div><div class="verse">
As cows and elephants and such,</div><div class="verse">
But more than any bull or ox,</div><div class="verse">
Rooster, ram, or sly old fox.</div><div class="verse">
Like any mule a goat likes hay</div><div class="verse">
And all tin cans we throw away.</div><div class="verse">
He's useful and I'm fond of him,</div><div class="verse">
But some good folks have a strange whim</div><div class="verse">
To hold their noses when he's near,</div><div class="verse">
And act as if they greatly fear</div><div class="verse">
To touch his fur which has the smell</div><div class="verse">
Of something I know very well.</div><div class="verse">

Poor Uncle Zeke, he's very sad, and says the whole world's wrong,</div><div class="verse">

Along an automobile came and whizzed him in the air.</div>

<div class="verse">
To-day I saw him lying still and pale upon his couch,</div><div class="verse">
And oh, my goodness gracious, but he had an awful grouch!</div><div class="verse">

And on his forehead was a bump like Aunt Mariah's cup.</div>

He told me I should listen well and take his counsel sage,</div><div class="verse">

No more than I would stoop to seize a common green back toad.</div>

</div>

<p class="cb">(From "The Woman's National Daily.")</p>

<p>The following rhyme was written by a little 6-year-old-girl in hopes
to save a beautiful forest near Evansville, Ind., and to help the Children's
Outing Farm. A short account of the little girl's work as an
Esperantist appeared in a recent issue of The National Daily and a number
of articles concerning her abilities as a linguist have appeared in
other publications.</p>

<p>She is the youngest child in the world holding a diploma from Dr.
Zamenhof for being able to read, write and speak in Esperanto, and she
also speaks French as well as English.</p>

<p>This little girl, who was born in Norfolk, Va., has been a lover of
books since her babyhood days. She knew Mother Goose by heart when
but 1 year of age and learned to read when but 2. At 4 she read Lamb's
Tales of Shakespeare and had finished the fifth reader. A few months
ago she was sent to school, but could not be graded, as she could read,
write and spell anything, but knew nothing of arithmetic. The noted
mathematician, Mrs. Hornbrook, of Chicago, having met the little girl
at Chautauqua, N. Y., and knowing of her mental powers, asked to instruct
her in this branch, and she soon taught her the rudiments of arithmetic.</p>

<p>She is the daughter of Dr. J. B. Stoner, Surgeon in the Public
Health and Marine Hospital Service, and Winifred Sackville Stoner,
President of the Woman's Esperanto League.</p>

These monarchs of the forest, these jewels of great worth.</div><div class="verse">
The giant oaks and stately elms, the rulers of this wood,</div><div class="verse">
Have watched the growth of Evansville and helped it as they could.</div><div class="verse">
They gave their shade and soft bright leaves to make a downy nest</div><div class="verse">
To shelter the first baby boy that Evansville possessed.</div><div class="verse">
Before this city had a church in which both bad and good</div><div class="verse">
Could ask forgiveness of the Lord, they worshipped in this wood;</div><div class="verse">
And those who love the beautiful and lovely scenes to see,</div><div class="verse">
They climb upon this grassy hill and stand beneath some tree,</div><div class="verse">
While gazing far as eye can reach to fair Kentucky's lands,</div><div class="verse">
Or looking at the river shore on which our city stands.</div><div class="verse">
Above their heads the bright blue sky, green grass beneath their feet,</div><div class="verse">
And all around a lovely scene such as we seldom meet;</div><div class="verse">
Green pastures with cows grazing, broad river flowing by,</div><div class="verse">
And many tall church spires lifted toward the sky.</div><div class="verse">
No fitter place for children nor grown-up folks could be</div><div class="verse">
Than on this lovely Coal Mine Hill where Nature we may see.</div><div class="verse">
'Tis here the little orphans and poor children all around</div><div class="verse">
Find the greatest pleasures which in this woods abound.</div><div class="verse">
So, dearest, kindest Fairies, please rescue these grand trees,</div><div class="verse">

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
